### Proposal Joseph Brazzale  
#### 10/06/2021

#### Question
For this project I am planning on building a model that will target the greatest areas of need for a tele-health 
company that specializes in mental health therapy. With my model, this company will be able to target specific 
area codes in the United States with higher rates of suicide. I also plan on finding remote areas with high rates of 
mental health issues that do not have access to therapists.

My target company will benefit by gaining users that they can then match to a therapist. People often refuse to go 
to therapy due to the stigma surrounding mental health. By promoting a telemed company in these areas, we can take a 
preventative approach to mental health issues in the US.

#### Data Description
All of my data is publicly available from the Center of Disease Control website. 
individual samples will be population figures from different zip codes. 
I am hoping to visualize specific areas in the US that are currently underserved for mental health care, these areas 
will take a higher priority for our ads.

#### Tools
Exploratory data analysis will be performed using Excel. I am also planning on storing my data in a SQLite database.
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
If needed, I plan on using Folium which is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data.
#### MVP Goal
A good MVP will highlight that there are in fact areas in the united states that need increased awareness for 
tele-health services
