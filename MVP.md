## Project 3 MVP 
### 10/12/21 -Joseph Brazzale 

For this project I have decided to take a two-fold approach to finding the best ways to advertise. The firs tleg will make use of US census 
data to find the wealthiest zip codes in the US. These will act as a primary souce of revenue for our psych telemed company. The second part of 
my approach was to find rural areas that have the greatest need for our services. 

To illustrate that these rural areas have a greater need for telemed, I have included a bar graph that shows that suicide rates in rural areas 
are greater than those in urban ones. The data was sourced from the National Vital Statistics System from the year 2019. 

Counties were classified using the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties 
They are grouped into either "Urban" or "Rural" with a few subcategories for each one.
